# CI/CD Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up the enhanced CI/CD pipeline for git-tag-based semversioning and automated releases.

## üöÄ Quick Setup

### 1. Install Enhanced GitHub Actions Workflows

Due to GitHub App permissions, the enhanced workflows need to be installed manually:

```bash
# Navigate to your repository
cd /path/to/twat-search

# Install enhanced workflows (replace existing ones)
mv .github/workflows/push-enhanced.yml.template .github/workflows/push.yml
mv .github/workflows/release-enhanced.yml.template .github/workflows/release.yml
mv .github/workflows/pre-release.yml.template .github/workflows/pre-release.yml

# Commit the changes
git add .github/workflows/
git commit -m "feat: enhance CI/CD workflows with multiplatform support and semver validation"
```

### 2. Set Up GitHub Secrets

Configure the following secrets in your GitHub repository (Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions):

#### Required Secrets:
- `PYPI_TOKEN` - PyPI API token for publishing releases
- `TEST_PYPI_TOKEN` - Test PyPI API token for pre-releases (optional)

#### Optional Secrets:
- `CODECOV_TOKEN` - Codecov token for coverage reporting (optional)

### 3. Configure GitHub Environments

Set up the following environments in your repository (Settings > Environments):

#### PyPI Environment:
- Name: `pypi`
- URL: `https://pypi.org/p/twat-search`
- Required reviewers: (optional, for manual approval)

#### Test PyPI Environment (optional):
- Name: `testpypi`
- URL: `https://test.pypi.org/p/twat-search`

## üìã Feature Overview

### Enhanced Push Workflow (`push.yml`)
- **Multiplatform Testing**: Ubuntu, Windows, macOS
- **Python Version Matrix**: 3.10, 3.11, 3.12
- **Code Quality**: Ruff linting, formatting, MyPy type checking
- **Binary Builds**: Standalone executables for all platforms
- **Coverage Reporting**: Comprehensive test coverage analysis
- **Artifact Management**: Stores binaries and coverage reports

### Enhanced Release Workflow (`release.yml`)
- **Semver Validation**: Automatic semantic version validation
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test suite on release
- **Distribution Building**: Python packages and platform binaries
- **PyPI Publishing**: Automated package publishing
- **GitHub Releases**: Automatic release creation with assets
- **Release Notes**: Auto-generated from changelog

### Pre-Release Workflow (`pre-release.yml`)
- **Manual Trigger**: Workflow dispatch for testing
- **Test PyPI**: Publishes to Test PyPI for validation
- **GitHub Pre-Release**: Creates pre-release for testing
- **Version Validation**: Supports pre-release versions (e.g., 1.0.0-alpha.1)

## üîß Local Development Scripts

The repository includes three powerful local development scripts:

### Build Script (`scripts/build.sh`)
```bash
# Full build pipeline
./scripts/build.sh

# Only code quality checks
./scripts/build.sh --quality

# Only run tests
./scripts/build.sh --test

# Only build package
./scripts/build.sh --build

# Build without tests
./scripts/build.sh --skip-tests
```

### Test Script (`scripts/test.sh`)
```bash
# Run all tests
./scripts/test.sh

# Run unit tests only
./scripts/test.sh --unit

# Run integration tests only
./scripts/test.sh --integration

# Run specific test pattern
./scripts/test.sh --pattern "search"

# Run tests with specific marker
./scripts/test.sh --marker "unit"

# Generate comprehensive test report
./scripts/test.sh --report

# Run in watch mode for continuous testing
./scripts/test.sh --watch
```

### Release Script (`scripts/release.sh`)
```bash
# Release a new version
./scripts/release.sh 1.0.0

# Show current version
./scripts/release.sh --current

# Suggest next version
./scripts/release.sh --major   # Next major version
./scripts/release.sh --minor   # Next minor version
./scripts/release.sh --patch   # Next patch version

# Dry run (show what would be done)
./scripts/release.sh --dry-run 1.0.0

# Create release and push tags
./scripts/release.sh --push-tags 1.0.0
```

## üéØ Release Process

### Regular Releases

1. **Ensure Clean State**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ./scripts/build.sh  # Run full build and tests
   ```

2. **Create Release**:
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Use the release script
   ./scripts/release.sh 1.0.0

   # Option 2: Manual git tag
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

3. **Automated Process**:
   - GitHub Actions validates the semver tag
   - Runs comprehensive tests on all platforms
   - Builds Python packages and binaries
   - Publishes to PyPI
   - Creates GitHub release with assets

### Pre-Releases

1. **Navigate to GitHub Actions**:
   - Go to your repository's Actions tab
   - Select "Pre-Release" workflow
   - Click "Run workflow"

2. **Configure Pre-Release**:
   - Enter version (e.g., `1.0.0-alpha.1`)
   - Choose whether to create git tag
   - Run the workflow

3. **Automated Process**:
   - Validates pre-release version format
   - Runs tests and builds packages
   - Publishes to Test PyPI
   - Creates GitHub pre-release

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Workflow Permission Errors**:
   - Ensure GitHub App has sufficient permissions
   - Check repository settings for Actions permissions

2. **PyPI Publishing Failures**:
   - Verify `PYPI_TOKEN` is correctly set
   - Check if version already exists on PyPI

3. **Binary Build Failures**:
   - Ensure all dependencies are properly listed
   - Check PyInstaller configuration for platform-specific issues

4. **Test Failures**:
   - Run tests locally with `./scripts/test.sh`
   - Check for platform-specific issues in the matrix

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check current git status
git status

# View recent commits
git log --oneline -10

# Check current version
./scripts/release.sh --current

# Run tests with verbose output
./scripts/test.sh --unit --verbose

# Build with verbose output
./scripts/build.sh --verbose
```

## üìä Monitoring

### GitHub Actions Monitoring
- Monitor workflow runs in the Actions tab
- Check for failed runs and error messages
- Review artifact uploads and downloads

### Coverage Monitoring
- Coverage reports are generated for each test run
- HTML reports available in artifacts
- Codecov integration (if configured)

### Release Monitoring
- Monitor PyPI for successful package uploads
- Check GitHub releases for proper asset uploads
- Verify binary functionality across platforms

## üîê Security Considerations

### Secrets Management
- Use GitHub repository secrets for sensitive data
- Never commit API tokens to the repository
- Regularly rotate API tokens

### Workflow Security
- Review workflow permissions regularly
- Use pinned action versions for security
- Monitor for security advisories

### Binary Security
- Binaries are built in isolated environments
- Consider code signing for production releases
- Verify binary integrity before distribution

## üöÄ Advanced Configuration

### Custom Environments
You can create additional environments for staging, testing, etc.:

```yaml
# In your workflow file
environment:
  name: staging
  url: https://staging.example.com
```

### Matrix Customization
Modify the test matrix in workflows for different configurations:

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    python-version: ["3.10", "3.11", "3.12"]
    os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]
    include:
      - python-version: "3.13"
        os: ubuntu-latest
```

### Custom Build Steps
Add custom build steps for specific requirements:

```yaml
- name: Custom Build Step
  run: |
    echo "Running custom build logic"
    # Your custom commands here
```
