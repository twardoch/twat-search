## Arguments for Calling fire.Fire()

| Argument  | Usage                     | Notes                                |
| --------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| component | `fire.Fire(component)`    | If omitted, defaults to a dict of all locals and globals. |
| command   | `fire.Fire(command='hello --name=5')` | Either a string or a list of arguments. If a string is provided, it is split to determine the arguments. If a list or tuple is provided, they are the arguments. If `command` is omitted, then `sys.argv[1:]` (the arguments from the command line) are used by default. |
| name      | `fire.Fire(name='tool')`  | The name of the CLI, ideally the name users will enter to run the CLI. This name will be used in the CLI's help screens. If the argument is omitted, it will be inferred automatically.|
| serialize | `fire.Fire(serialize=custom_serializer)` | If omitted, simple types are serialized via their builtin str method, and any objects that define a custom `__str__` method are serialized with that. If specified, all objects are serialized to text via the provided method. |

## Using a Fire CLI without modifying any code

You can use Python Fire on a module without modifying the code of the module.
The syntax for this is:

`python -m fire <module> <arguments>`

or

`python -m fire <filepath> <arguments>`

For example, `python -m fire calendar -h` will treat the built in `calendar`
module as a CLI and provide its help.

# Benefits of Python Fire

<a name="simple-cli"></a>
## Create CLIs in Python

It's dead simple. Simply write the functionality you want exposed at the command
line as a function / module / class, and then call Fire. With this addition of a
single-line call to Fire, your CLI is ready to go.

<a name="debugging"></a>
## Develop and debug Python code

When you're writing a Python library, you probably want to try it out as you go.
You could write a main method to check the functionality you're interested in,
but then you have to change the main method with every new experiment you're
interested in testing, and constantly updating the main method is a hassle.
You could also open an IPython REPL and import your library there and test it,
but then you have to deal with reloading your imports every time you change
something.

If you simply call Fire in your library, then you can run all of it's
functionality from the command line without having to keep making changes to
a main method. And if you use the `--interactive` flag to enter an IPython REPL
then you don't need to load the imports or create your variables; they'll
already be ready for use as soon as you start the REPL.

<a name="exploring"></a>
## Explore existing code; turn other people's code into a CLI

You can take an existing module, maybe even one that you don't have access to
the source code for, and call `Fire` on it. This lets you easily see what
functionality this code exposes, without you having to read through all the
code.

This technique can be a very simple way to create very powerful CLIs. Call
`Fire` on the difflib library and you get a powerful diffing tool. Call `Fire`
on the Python Imaging Library (PIL) module and you get a powerful image
manipulation command line tool, very similar in nature to ImageMagick.

The auto-generated help strings that Fire provides when you run a Fire CLI
allow you to see all the functionality these modules provide in a concise
manner.

<a name="bash"></a>
## Transition between Bash and Python

Using Fire lets you call Python directly from Bash. So you can mix your Python
functions with the unix tools you know and love, like `grep`, `xargs`, `wc`,
etc.

Additionally since writing CLIs in Python requires only a single call to Fire,
it is now easy to write even one-off scripts that would previously have been in
Bash, in Python.

<a name="repl"></a>
## Explore code in a Python REPL

When you use the `--interactive` flag to enter an IPython REPL, it starts with
variables and modules already defined for you. You don't need to waste time
importing the modules you care about or defining the variables you're going to
use, since Fire has already done so for you.

## The Python Fire Guide

### Introduction

Welcome to the Python Fire guide! Python Fire is a Python library that will turn
any Python component into a command line interface with just a single call to
`Fire`.

Let's get started!

### Installation

To install Python Fire from pypi, run:

`pip install fire`

Alternatively, to install Python Fire from source, clone the source and run:

`python setup.py install`

### Hello World

##### Version 1: `fire.Fire()`

The easiest way to use Fire is to take any Python program, and then simply call
`fire.Fire()` at the end of the program. This will expose the full contents of
the program to the command line.

```python
import fire

def hello(name):
  return f'Hello {name}!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
  fire.Fire()
```

Here's how we can run our program from the command line:

```bash
$ python example.py hello World
Hello World!
```

##### Version 2: `fire.Fire(<fn>)`

Let's modify our program slightly to only expose the `hello` function to the
command line.

```python
import fire

def hello(name):
  return f'Hello {name}!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
  fire.Fire(hello)
```

Here's how we can run this from the command line:

```bash
$ python example.py World
Hello World!
```

Notice we no longer have to specify to run the `hello` function, because we
called `fire.Fire(hello)`.

##### Version 3: Using a main

We can alternatively write this program like this:

```python
import fire

def hello(name):
  return f'Hello {name}!'

def main():
  fire.Fire(hello)

if __name__ == '__main__':
  main()
```

Or if we're using
[entry points](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pkg_resources.html#entry-points),
then simply this:

```python
import fire

def hello(name):
  return f'Hello {name}!'

def main():
  fire.Fire(hello)
```

##### Version 4: Fire Without Code Changes

If you have a file `example.py` that doesn't even import fire:

```python
def hello(name):
  return f'Hello {name}!'
```

Then you can use it with Fire like this:

```bash
$ python -m fire example hello --name=World
Hello World!
```

You can also specify the filepath of example.py rather than its module path,
like so:

```bash
$ python -m fire example.py hello --name=World
Hello World!
```

### Exposing Multiple Commands

In the previous example, we exposed a single function to the command line. Now
we'll look at ways of exposing multiple functions to the command line.

##### Version 1: `fire.Fire()`

The simplest way to expose multiple commands is to write multiple functions, and
then call Fire.

```python
import fire

def add(x, y):
  return x + y

def multiply(x, y):
  return x * y

if __name__ == '__main__':
  fire.Fire()
```

We can use this like so:

```bash
$ python example.py add 10 20
30
$ python example.py multiply 10 20
200
```

You'll notice that Fire correctly parsed `10` and `20` as numbers, rather than
as strings. Read more about [argument parsing here](#argument-parsing).

##### Version 2: `fire.Fire(<dict>)`

In version 1 we exposed all the program's functionality to the command line. By
using a dict, we can selectively expose functions to the command line.

```python
import fire

def add(x, y):
  return x + y

def multiply(x, y):
  return x * y

if __name__ == '__main__':
  fire.Fire({
      'add': add,
      'multiply': multiply,
  })
```

We can use this in the same way as before:

```bash
$ python example.py add 10 20
30
$ python example.py multiply 10 20
200
```

##### Version 3: `fire.Fire(<object>)`

Fire also works on objects, as in this variant. This is a good way to expose
multiple commands.

```python
import fire

class Calculator(object):

  def add(self, x, y):
    return x + y

  def multiply(self, x, y):
    return x * y

if __name__ == '__main__':
  calculator = Calculator()
  fire.Fire(calculator)
```

We can use this in the same way as before:

```bash
$ python example.py add 10 20
30
$ python example.py multiply 10 20
200
```


##### Version 4: `fire.Fire(<class>)`

Fire also works on classes. This is another good way to expose multiple
commands.

```python
import fire

class Calculator(object):

  def add(self, x, y):
    return x + y

  def multiply(self, x, y):
    return x * y

if __name__ == '__main__':
  fire.Fire(Calculator)
```

We can use this in the same way as before:

```bash
$ python example.py add 10 20
30
$ python example.py multiply 10 20
200
```

Why might you prefer a class over an object? One reason is that you can pass
arguments for constructing the class too, as in this broken calculator example.

```python
import fire

class BrokenCalculator(object):

  def __init__(self, offset=1):
      self._offset = offset

  def add(self, x, y):
    return x + y + self._offset

  def multiply(self, x, y):
    return x * y + self._offset

if __name__ == '__main__':
  fire.Fire(BrokenCalculator)
```

When you use a broken calculator, you get wrong answers:

```bash
$ python example.py add 10 20
31
$ python example.py multiply 10 20
201
```

But you can always fix it:

```bash
$ python example.py add 10 20 --offset=0
30
$ python example.py multiply 10 20 --offset=0
200
```

Unlike calling ordinary functions, which can be done both with positional
arguments and named arguments (--flag syntax), arguments to \_\_init\_\_
functions must be passed with the --flag syntax. See the section on
[calling functions](#calling-functions) for more.

### Grouping Commands

Here's an example of how you might make a command line interface with grouped
commands.

```python
class IngestionStage(object):

  def run(self):
    return 'Ingesting! Nom nom nom...'

class DigestionStage(object):

  def run(self, volume=1):
    return ' '.join(['Burp!'] * volume)

  def status(self):
    return 'Satiated.'

class Pipeline(object):

  def __init__(self):
    self.ingestion = IngestionStage()
    self.digestion = DigestionStage()

  def run(self):
    ingestion_output = self.ingestion.run()
    digestion_output = self.digestion.run()
    return [ingestion_output, digestion_output]

if __name__ == '__main__':
  fire.Fire(Pipeline)
```

Here's how this looks at the command line:

```bash
$ python example.py run
Ingesting! Nom nom nom...
Burp!
$ python example.py ingestion run
Ingesting! Nom nom nom...
$ python example.py digestion run
Burp!
$ python example.py digestion status
Satiated.
```

You can nest your commands in arbitrarily complex ways, if you're feeling grumpy
or adventurous.


### Accessing Properties

In the examples we've looked at so far, our invocations of `python example.py`
have all run some function from the example program. In this example, we simply
access a property.

```python
from airports import airports

import fire

class Airport(object):

  def __init__(self, code):
    self.code = code
    self.name = dict(airports).get(self.code)
    self.city = self.name.split(',')[0] if self.name else None

if __name__ == '__main__':
  fire.Fire(Airport)
```

Now we can use this program to learn about airport codes!

```bash
$ python example.py --code=JFK code
JFK
$ python example.py --code=SJC name
San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, CA - Norman Y. Mineta San Jose International (SJC)
$ python example.py --code=ALB city
Albany-Schenectady-Troy
```

By the way, you can find this
[airports module here](https://github.com/trendct-data/airports.py).

### Chaining Function Calls

When you run a Fire CLI, you can take all the same actions on the _result_ of
the call to Fire that you can take on the original object passed in.

For example, we can use our Airport CLI from the previous example like this:

```bash
$ python example.py --code=ALB city upper
ALBANY-SCHENECTADY-TROY
```

This works since `upper` is a method on all strings.

So, if you want to set up your functions to chain nicely, all you have to do is
have a class whose methods return self. Here's an example.

```python
import fire

class BinaryCanvas(object):
  """A canvas with which to make binary art, one bit at a time."""

  def __init__(self, size=10):
    self.pixels = [[0] * size for _ in range(size)]
    self._size = size
    self._row = 0  # The row of the cursor.
    self._col = 0  # The column of the cursor.

  def __str__(self):
    return '\n'.join(' '.join(str(pixel) for pixel in row) for row in self.pixels)

  def show(self):
    print(self)
    return self

  def move(self, row, col):
    self._row = row % self._size
    self._col = col % self._size
    return self

  def on(self):
    return self.set(1)

  def off(self):
    return self.set(0)

  def set(self, value):
    self.pixels[self._row][self._col] = value
    return self

if __name__ == '__main__':
  fire.Fire(BinaryCanvas)
```

Now we can draw stuff :).

```bash
$ python example.py move 3 3 on move 3 6 on move 6 3 on move 6 6 on move 7 4 on move 7 5 on
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

It's supposed to be a smiley face.

### Custom Serialization

You'll notice in the BinaryCanvas example, the canvas with the smiley face was
printed to the screen. You can determine how a component will be serialized by
defining its `__str__` method.

If a custom `__str__` method is present on the final component, the object is
serialized and printed. If there's no custom `__str__` method, then the help
screen for the object is shown instead.

### Can we make an even simpler example than Hello World?

Yes, this program is even simpler than our original Hello World example.

```python
import fire
english = 'Hello World'
spanish = 'Hola Mundo'
fire.Fire()
```

You can use it like this:

```bash
$ python example.py english
Hello World
$ python example.py spanish
Hola Mundo
```

### Calling Functions

Arguments to a constructor are passed by name using flag syntax `--name=value`.

For example, consider this simple class:

```python
import fire

class Building(object):

  def __init__(self, name, stories=1):
    self.name = name
    self.stories = stories

  def climb_stairs(self, stairs_per_story=10):
    for story in range(self.stories):
      for stair in range(1, stairs_per_story):
        yield stair
      yield 'Phew!'
    yield 'Done!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
  fire.Fire(Building)
```

We can instantiate it as follows: `python example.py --name="Sherrerd Hall"`

Arguments to other functions may be passed positionally or by name using flag
syntax.

To instantiate a `Building` and then run the `climb_stairs` function, the
following commands are all valid:

```bash
$ python example.py --name="Sherrerd Hall" --stories=3 climb_stairs 10
$ python example.py --name="Sherrerd Hall" climb_stairs --stairs_per_story=10
$ python example.py --name="Sherrerd Hall" climb_stairs --stairs-per-story 10
$ python example.py climb-stairs --stairs-per-story 10 --name="Sherrerd Hall"
```

You'll notice that hyphens and underscores (`-` and `_`) are interchangeable in
member names and flag names.

You'll also notice that the constructor's arguments can come after the
function's arguments or before the function.

You'll also notice that the equal sign between the flag name and its value is
optional.

##### Functions with `*varargs` and `**kwargs`

Fire supports functions that take \*varargs or \*\*kwargs. Here's an example:

```python
import fire

def order_by_length(*items):
  """Orders items by length, breaking ties alphabetically."""
  sorted_items = sorted(items, key=lambda item: (len(str(item)), str(item)))
  return ' '.join(sorted_items)

if __name__ == '__main__':
  fire.Fire(order_by_length)
```

To use it, we run:

```bash
$ python example.py dog cat elephant
cat dog elephant
```

You can use a separator to indicate that you're done providing arguments to a
function. All arguments after the separator will be used to process the result
of the function, rather than being passed to the function itself. The default
separator is the hyphen `-`.

Here's an example where we use a separator.

```bash
$ python example.py dog cat elephant - upper
CAT DOG ELEPHANT
```

Without the separator, upper would have been treated as another argument.

```bash
$ python example.py dog cat elephant upper
cat dog upper elephant
```

You can change the separator with the `--separator` flag. Flags are always
separated from your Fire command by an isolated `--`. Here's an example where we
change the separator.

```bash
$ python example.py dog cat elephant X upper -- --separator=X
CAT DOG ELEPHANT
```

Separators can be useful when a function accepts \*varargs, \*\*kwargs, or
default values that you don't want to specify. It is also important to remember
to change the separator if you want to pass `-` as an argument.


##### Async Functions

Fire supports calling async functions too. Here's a simple example.

```python
import asyncio

async def count_to_ten():
  for i in range(1, 11):
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print(i)

if __name__ == '__main__':
  fire.Fire(count_to_ten)
```

Whenever fire encounters a coroutine function, it runs it, blocking until it completes.


### Argument Parsing

The types of the arguments are determined by their values, rather than by the
function signature where they're used. You can pass any Python literal from the
command line: numbers, strings, tuples, lists, dictionaries, (sets are only
supported in some versions of Python). You can also nest the collections
arbitrarily as long as they only contain literals.

To demonstrate this, we'll make a small example program that tells us the type
of any argument we give it:

```python
import fire
fire.Fire(lambda obj: type(obj).__name__)
```

And we'll use it like so:

```bash
$ python example.py 10
int
$ python example.py 10.0
float
$ python example.py hello
str
$ python example.py '(1,2)'
tuple
$ python example.py [1,2]
list
$ python example.py True
bool
$ python example.py {name:David}
dict
```

You'll notice in that last example that bare-words are automatically replaced
with strings.

Be careful with your quotes! If you want to pass the string `"10"`, rather than
the int `10`, you'll need to either escape or quote your quotes. Otherwise Bash
will eat your quotes and pass an unquoted `10` to your Python program, where
Fire will interpret it as a number.


```bash
$ python example.py 10
int
$ python example.py "10"
int
$ python example.py '"10"'
str
$ python example.py "'10'"
str
$ python example.py \"10\"
str
```

Be careful with your quotes! Remember that Bash processes your arguments first,
and then Fire parses the result of that.
If you wanted to pass the dict `{"name": "David Bieber"}` to your program, you
might try this:

```bash
$ python example.py '{"name": "David Bieber"}'  # Good! Do this.
dict
$ python example.py {"name":'"David Bieber"'}  # Okay.
dict
$ python example.py {"name":"David Bieber"}  # Wrong. This is parsed as a string.
str
$ python example.py {"name": "David Bieber"}  # Wrong. This isn't even treated as a single argument.
<error>
$ python example.py '{"name": "Justin Bieber"}'  # Wrong. This is not the Bieber you're looking for. (The syntax is fine though :))
dict
```

##### Boolean Arguments

The tokens `True` and `False` are parsed as boolean values.

You may also specify booleans via flag syntax `--name` and `--noname`, which set
`name` to `True` and `False` respectively.

Continuing the previous example, we could run any of the following:

```bash
$ python example.py --obj=True
bool
$ python example.py --obj=False
bool
$ python example.py --obj
bool
$ python example.py --noobj
bool
```

Be careful with boolean flags! If a token other than another flag immediately
follows a flag that's supposed to be a boolean, the flag will take on the value
of the token rather than the boolean value. You can resolve this: by putting a
separator after your last flag, by explicitly stating the value of the boolean
flag (as in `--obj=True`), or by making sure there's another flag after any
boolean flag argument.


### Using Fire Flags

Fire CLIs all come with a number of flags. These flags should be separated from
the Fire command by an isolated `--`. If there is at least one isolated `--`
argument, then arguments after the final isolated `--` are treated as flags,
whereas all arguments before the final isolated `--` are considered part of the
Fire command.

One useful flag is the `--interactive` flag. Use the `--interactive` flag on any
CLI to enter a Python REPL with all the modules and variables used in the
context where `Fire` was called already available to you for use. Other useful
variables, such as the result of the Fire command will also be available. Use
this feature like this: `python example.py -- --interactive`.

You can add the help flag to any command to see help and usage information. Fire
incorporates your docstrings into the help and usage information that it
generates. Fire will try to provide help even if you omit the isolated `--`
separating the flags from the Fire command, but may not always be able to, since
`help` is a valid argument name. Use this feature like this: `python
example.py -- --help` or `python example.py --help` (or even `python example.py
-h`).

The complete set of flags available is shown below, in the reference section.

| Argument  | Usage                     | Notes                                |
| --------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| component | `fire.Fire(component)`    | If omitted, defaults to a dict of all locals and globals. |
| command   | `fire.Fire(command='hello --name=5')` | Either a string or a list of arguments. If a string is provided, it is split to determine the arguments. If a list or tuple is provided, they are the arguments. If `command` is omitted, then `sys.argv[1:]` (the arguments from the command line) are used by default. |
| name      | `fire.Fire(name='tool')`  | The name of the CLI, ideally the name users will enter to run the CLI. This name will be used in the CLI's help screens. If the argument is omitted, it will be inferred automatically.|
| serialize | `fire.Fire(serialize=custom_serializer)` | If omitted, simple types are serialized via their builtin str method, and any objects that define a custom `__str__` method are serialized with that. If specified, all objects are serialized to text via the provided method. |

    [[5]](benefits.md#repl)

## Installation

To install Python Fire with pip, run: `pip install fire`

To install Python Fire with conda, run: `conda install fire -c conda-forge`

To install Python Fire from source, first clone the repository and then run:
`python setup.py install`

## Basic Usage

You can call `Fire` on any Python object:<br>
functions, classes, modules, objects, dictionaries, lists, tuples, etc.
They all work!

Here's an example of calling Fire on a function.

```python
import fire

def hello(name="World"):
  return "Hello %s!" % name

if __name__ == '__main__':
  fire.Fire(hello)
```

Then, from the command line, you can run:

```bash
python hello.py  # Hello World!
python hello.py --name=David  # Hello David!
python hello.py --help  # Shows usage information.
```

Here's an example of calling Fire on a class.

```python
import fire

class Calculator(object):
  """A simple calculator class."""

  def double(self, number):
    return 2 * number

if __name__ == '__main__':
  fire.Fire(Calculator)
```

Then, from the command line, you can run:

```bash
python calculator.py double 10  # 20
python calculator.py double --number=15  # 30
```

To learn how Fire behaves on functions, objects, dicts, lists, etc, and to learn
about Fire's other features, see the [Using a Fire CLI page](using-cli.md).

For additional examples, see [The Python Fire Guide](guide.md).

## Why is it called Fire?

When you call `Fire`, it fires off (executes) your command.

## Where can I learn more?

Please see [The Python Fire Guide](guide.md).

# Troubleshooting

This page describes known issues that users of Python Fire have run into. If you
have an issue not resolved here, consider opening a
[GitHub Issue](https://github.com/google/python-fire/issues).

### Issue [#19](https://github.com/google/python-fire/issues/19): Don't name your module "cmd"

If you have a module name that conflicts with the name of a builtin module, then
when Fire goes to import the builtin module, it will import your module instead.
This will result in an error, possibly an `AttributeError`. Specifically, do not
name your module any of the following:
sys, linecache, cmd, bdb, repr, os, re, pprint, traceback

docs/using-cli.md
# Using a Fire CLI

## Basic usage

Every Fire command corresponds to a Python component.

The simplest Fire command consists of running your program with no additional
arguments. This command corresponds to the Python component you called the
`Fire` function on. If you did not supply an object in the call to `Fire`, then
the context in which `Fire` was called will be used as the Python component.

You can append `--help` or `-h` to a command to see what Python component it
corresponds to, as well as the various ways in which you can extend the command.

Flags to Fire should be separated from the Fire command by an isolated `--` in
order to distinguish between flags and named arguments. So, for example, to
enter interactive mode append `-- -i` or `-- --interactive` to any command. To
use Fire in verbose mode, append `-- --verbose`.

Given a Fire command that corresponds to a Python object, you can extend that
command to access a member of that object, call it with arguments if it is a
function, instantiate it if it is a class, or index into it if it is a list.

Read on to learn about how you can write a Fire command corresponding to
whatever Python component you're looking for.


### Accessing members of an object

If your command corresponds to an object, you can extend your command by adding
the name of a member of that object as a new argument to the command. The
resulting command will correspond to that member.

For example, if the object your command corresponds to has a method defined on
it named 'whack', then you can add the argument 'whack' to your command, and the
resulting new command corresponds to the whack method.

As another example, if the object your command corresponds to has a property
named high_score, then you can add the argument 'high-score' to your command,
and the resulting new command corresponds to the value of the high_score
property.


### Accessing members of a dict

If your command corresponds to a dict, you can extend your command by adding
the name of one of the dict's keys as an argument.

For example, `widget function-that-returns-dict key` will correspond to the
value of the item with key `key` in the dict returned by
`function_that_returns_dict`.


### Accessing members of a list or tuple

If your command corresponds to a list or tuple, you can extend your command by
adding the index of an element of the component to your command as an argument.

For example, `widget function-that-returns-list 2` will correspond to item 2 of
the result of `function_that_returns_list`.


### Calling a function

If your command corresponds to a function, you can extend your command by adding
the arguments of this function. Arguments can be specified positionally, or by
name. To specify an argument by name, use flag syntax.

For example, suppose your `command` corresponds to the function `double`:

```python
def double(value=0):
  return 2 * value
```

Then you can extend your command using named arguments as `command --value 5`,
or using positional arguments as `command 5`. In both cases, the new command
corresponds to the result of the function, in this case the number 10.

You can force a function that takes a variable number of arguments to be
evaluated by adding a separator (the default separator is the hyphen, "-"). This
will prevent arguments to the right of the separator from being consumed for
calling the function. This is useful if the function has arguments with default
values, or if the function accepts \*varargs, or if the function accepts
\*\*kwargs.

See also the section on [Changing the Separator](#separator-flag).


### Instantiating a class

If your command corresponds to a class, you can extend your command by adding
the arguments of the class's `__init__` function. Arguments must be specified
by name, using the flags syntax. See the section on
[calling a function](#calling-a-function) for more details.

Similarly, when passing arguments to a callable object (an object with a custom
`__call__` function), those arguments must be passed using flags syntax.

## Using Flags with Fire CLIs <a name="using-flags"></a>

Command line arguments to a Fire CLI are normally consumed by Fire, as described
in the [Basic Usage](#basic-usage) section. In order to set Flags, put the flags
after the final standalone `--` argument. (If there is no `--` argument, then no
arguments are used for flags.)

For example, to set the alsologtostderr flag, you could run the command:
`widget bang --noise=boom -- --alsologtostderr`. The `--noise` argument is
consumed by Fire, but the `--alsologtostderr` argument is treated as a normal
Flag.

All CLIs built with Python Fire share some flags, as described in the next
sections.


## Python Fire's Flags

As described in the [Using Flags](#using-flags) section, you must add an
isolated `--` argument in order to have arguments treated as Flags rather than
be consumed by Python Fire. All arguments to a Fire CLI after the final
standalone `--` argument are treated as Flags.

The following flags are accepted by all Fire CLIs:
[`--interactive`/`-i`](#interactive-flag),
[`--help`/`-h`](#help-flag),
[`--separator`](#separator-flag),
[`--completion`](#completion-flag),
[`--trace`](#trace-flag),
and [`--verbose`/`-v`](#verbose-flag),
as described in the following sections.

### `--interactive`: Interactive mode <a name="interactive-flag"></a>

Call `widget -- --interactive` or `widget -- -i` to enter interactive mode. This
will put you in an IPython REPL, with the variable `widget` already defined.

You can then explore the Python object that `widget` corresponds to
interactively using Python.

Note: if you want fire to start the IPython REPL instead of the regular Python one,
the `ipython` package needs to be installed in your environment.


### `--completion`: Generating a completion script <a name="completion-flag"></a>

Call `widget -- --completion` to generate a completion script for the Fire CLI
`widget`. To save the completion script to your home directory, you could e.g.
run `widget -- --completion > ~/.widget-completion`. You should then source this
file; to get permanent completion, source this file from your `.bashrc` file.

Call `widget -- --completion fish` to generate a completion script for the Fish
shell. Source this file from your fish.config.

If the commands available in the Fire CLI change, you'll have to regenerate the
completion script and source it again.


### `--help`: Getting help <a name="help-flag"></a>

Let say you have a command line tool named `widget` that was made with Fire. How
do you use this Fire CLI?

The simplest way to get started is to run `widget -- --help`. This will give you
usage information for your CLI. You can always append `-- --help` to any Fire
command in order to get usage information for that command and any subcommands.

Additionally, help will be displayed if you hit an error using Fire. For
example, if you try to pass too many or too few arguments to a function, then
help will be displayed. Similarly, if you try to access a member that does not
exist, or if you index into a list with too high an index, then help will be
displayed.

The displayed help shows information about which Python component your command
corresponds to, as well as usage information for how to extend that command.


### `--trace`: Getting a Fire trace <a name="trace-flag"></a>

In order to understand what is happening when you call Python Fire, it can be
useful to request a trace. This is done via the `--trace` flag, e.g.
`widget whack 5 -- --trace`.

A trace provides step by step information about how the Fire command was
executed. In includes which actions were taken, starting with the initial
component, leading to the final component represented by the command.

A trace is also shown alongside the help if your Fire command reaches an error.


### `--separator`: Changing the separator <a name="separator-flag"></a>

As described in [Calling a Function](#calling-a-function), you can use a
separator argument when writing a command that corresponds to calling a
function. The separator will cause the function to be evaluated or the class to
be instantiated using only the arguments left of the separator. Arguments right
of the separator will then be applied to the result of the function call or to
the instantiated object.

The default separator is `-`.

If you want to supply the string "-" as an argument, then you will have to
change the separator. You can choose a new separator by supplying the
`--separator` flag to Fire.

Here's an example to demonstrate separator usage. Let's say you have a function
that takes a variable number of args, and you want to call that function, and
then upper case the result. Here's how to do it:

```python
# Here's the Python function
def display(arg1, arg2='!'):
  return arg1 + arg2
```

```bash
# Here's what you can do from Bash (Note: the default separator is the hyphen -)
display hello                         # hello!
display hello upper                   # helloupper
display hello - upper                 # HELLO!
display - SEP upper -- --separator SEP    # -!
```
Notice how in the third and fourth lines, the separator caused the display
function to be called with the default value for arg2. In the fourth example,
we change the separator to the string "SEP" so that we can pass '-' as an
argument.

### `--verbose`: Verbose usage <a name="verbose-flag"></a>

Adding the `-v` or `--verbose` flag turns on verbose mode. This will eg
reveal private members in the usage string. Often these members will not
actually be usable from the command line tool. As such, verbose mode should be
considered a debugging tool, but not fully supported yet.

r"""A command line tool for diffing files.

The Python 2.7 documentation demonstrates how to make a command line interface
for the difflib library using optparse:
https://docs.python.org/2/library/difflib.html#a-command-line-interface-to-difflib

This file demonstrates how to create a command line interface providing the same
functionality using Python Fire.

Usage:

diff FROMFILE TOFILE COMMAND [LINES]

Arguments can be passed positionally or via the Flag syntax.
Using positional arguments, the usage is:

diff FROMFILE TOFILE
diff FROMFILE TOFILE context-diff [LINES]
diff FROMFILE TOFILE unified-diff [LINES]
diff FROMFILE TOFILE ndiff
diff FROMFILE TOFILE make-file [CONTEXT] [LINES]

Using the Flag syntax, the usage is:

diff --fromfile=FROMFILE --tofile=TOFILE
diff --fromfile=FROMFILE --tofile=TOFILE context-diff [--lines=LINES]
diff --fromfile=FROMFILE --tofile=TOFILE unified-diff [--lines=LINES]
diff --fromfile=FROMFILE --tofile=TOFILE ndiff
diff --fromfile=FROMFILE --tofile=TOFILE make-file \
    [--context=CONTEXT] [--lines LINES]

As with any Fire CLI, you can append '--' followed by any Flags to any command.

The Flags available for all Fire CLIs are:
  --help
  --interactive
  --trace
  --separator=SEPARATOR
  --completion
  --verbose

"""A command line tool for diffing files.

This demonstrates the simplest possible way to turn a module into a command line
interface with Python Fire. It exemplifies the power and shortcomings of relying
on Python Fire's simplicity.

See //fire/examples/diff/diff.py for another way of turning
difflib into a CLI that requires more code, but gives the developer more control
over the CLI's API.

Use the help flag to see usage for all the things this CLI can do. For example:

difffull -- -h
difffull HtmlDiff -- -h  # Help for the HtmlDiff class
difffull HtmlDiff - -- -h  # Help for an HtmlDiff object, not the HtmlDiff class

Here are some of the diff commands available:

difffull ndiff A B [LINEJUNK] [CHARJUNK]
difffull context-diff A B [FROMFILE] [TOFILE] [FROMFILEDATE] [TOFILEDATE] [N]
difffull unified-diff A B [FROMFILE] [TOFILE] [FROMFILEDATE] [TOFILEDATE] [N]
difffull HtmlDiff - make-file FROMLINES TOLINES [FROMDESC] [TODESC] [CONTEXT]

_**Assistant**_

<think>I need to implement a Fire CLI for `twat_search` that ties together the main module with the web CLI submodule. Let's break down the requirements:

1. Create a general Fire CLI in `src/twat_search/__main__.py` that exposes the `web/cli.py` functions as the `cli` subcommand
2. Ensure `src/twat_search/web/cli.py` is properly set up to work with this
3. Register the appropriate console scripts in `pyproject.toml`

Let's first examine the current structure of the project to understand what we're working with.

First, I'll check if `web/cli.py` exists and what it contains:

Let's first list the directory to see what files are available and understand the project structure:

```
src/twat_search/__main__.py
```

The TODO mentions `web/cli.py`, but I don't see it in the provided files. Let me check if this file exists in the project:

Let me examine the file structure more closely to see what we're working with:

It looks like I only have access to the single file `src/twat_search/__main__.py` with a TODO comment. I don't have direct access to `web/cli.py` or `pyproject.toml` yet.

Given this limitation, I'll need to:

1. First implement the main Fire CLI in `__main__.py`
2. Then check if `web/cli.py` exists and examine it
3. Finally update `pyproject.toml` if I can access it

Let's start by implementing the main Fire CLI:

For creating a general Fire CLI in `__main__.py`, I'll need to:
1. Import the Fire library
2. Create a main class or structure that will serve as the CLI interface
3. Make sure it exposes the web/cli.py functionality as the 'cli' subcommand
4. Set up the Fire CLI with this structure

The code should look something like this:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# this_file: src/twat_search/__main__.py

import fire
import importlib
import sys
from pathlib import Path

# Try to import the web.cli module
try:
    from twat_search.web import cli as web_cli
except ImportError:
    web_cli = None


class TwatSearchCLI:
    """TWAT Search Command Line Interface."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        """Initialize the TWAT Search CLI."""
        # If web_cli is available, expose it as a subcommand
        if web_cli:
            self.cli = web_cli
        else:
            # Create a placeholder if the web CLI is not available
            self.cli = lambda: print("Web CLI not available. Make sure twat_search.web.cli is properly installed.")
    
    def version(self):
        """Display the version of the TWAT Search tool."""
        try:
            from twat_search import __version__
            return f"TWAT Search version {__version__}"
        except ImportError:
            return "TWAT Search (version not available)"


def main():
    """Main entry point for the TWAT Search CLI."""
    # Create the CLI with Fire and expose it
    fire.Fire(TwatSearchCLI, name="twat-search")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Next, I need to check if the `web/cli.py` file exists and what it contains. Without seeing that file, I'll assume it needs to be created/updated to be compatible with the main CLI. 

For `web/cli.py`, I would expect it to define functions or a class that can be imported and used by the main CLI. If it doesn't exist or doesn't have the right structure, we'll need to create/update it.

Finally, for the `pyproject.toml` file, we'll need to add a console scripts entry to make the CLI available as a command. This would typically look like:

```toml
[project.scripts]
twat-search = "twat_search.__main__:main"
```

Let me check if I can access these files next to continue implementation.

Given that we don't have more files to look at, I'll assume I need to create all the necessary components. Let's proceed with the full implementation:

1. For `src/twat_search/__main__.py`, I'll implement a Fire CLI that can expose the `web/cli.py` as a subcommand.
2. For `src/twat_search/web/cli.py`, I'll create a placeholder file that can be properly imported by the main CLI.
3. For `pyproject.toml`, I'll provide the necessary configuration for console scripts.

Let's start with these implementations.

Hmm, I still don't have access to the entire file structure. Let me first focus on implementing the Fire CLI in `__main__.py`, which is the first requirement.

Based on the Python Fire documentation I've seen in the provided material, the implementation should be straightforward:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# this_file: src/twat_search/__main__.py

import fire
import importlib
import sys
from pathlib import Path

class TwatSearchCLI:
    """TWAT Search Command Line Interface."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        """Initialize the TWAT Search CLI."""
        # Dynamically import the web.cli module to handle any import errors gracefully
        try:
            from twat_search.web import cli as web_cli_module
            self.cli = web_cli_module.cli  # Assuming cli.py has a 'cli' function or class
        except (ImportError, AttributeError) as e:
            # Create a placeholder that reports the error if the web CLI is not available
            def cli_error(*args, **kwargs):
                print(f"Web CLI not available: {str(e)}")
                print("Make sure twat_search.web.cli is properly installed.")
                return 1
            self.cli = cli_error
    
    def version(self):
        """Display the version of the TWAT Search tool."""
        try:
            from twat_search import __version__
            return f"TWAT Search version {__version__}"
        except ImportError:
            return "TWAT Search (version not available)"


def main():
    """Main entry point for the TWAT Search CLI."""
    # Create the CLI with Fire and expose it
    fire.Fire(TwatSearchCLI, name="twat-search")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This implementation attempts to:
1. Create a main CLI class (`TwatSearchCLI`)
2. Import the web CLI module and expose it as the `cli` subcommand
3. Handle cases where the web CLI might not be available
4. Provide a `version` command for basic functionality

For the `web/cli.py` file, I'd want to implement something that works well with the main CLI, but I can't modify it directly if I don't have access to it.

For `pyproject.toml`, I'd want to add the console script entry, but again, I can't modify it directly if I don't have access to it.

Let me know if I should modify the current implementation or if you'd like me to provide code for the other files as well.

Let me check the file structure again to see if I can access other files.

Hmm, I can't see the file structure directly. Ok, I'll adapt my approach. I'll implement all three required files and provide the code for each:

1. For `src/twat_search/__main__.py`:
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# this_file: src/twat_search/__main__.py

"""

    fire.Fire(WebCLI(), name="twat-search-web")


# This is used when cli.py is imported by __main__.py
cli = WebCLI()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

3. For `pyproject.toml` (assuming it exists, add these lines):
```toml
[project.scripts]
twat-search = "twat_search.__main__:main"
twat-search-web = "twat_search.web.cli:main"
```

These implementations should work together as follows:

1. The main CLI (`__main__.py`) imports the web CLI module and exposes it as the `cli` subcommand.
2. The web CLI (`web/cli.py`) provides functionality for web search and serving.
3. The console scripts entries make both CLIs available as commands: `twat-search` and `twat-search-web`.

A user could then run:
- `twat-search version` to see the version
- `twat-search cli search "my query"` to use the web search
- `twat-search cli serve` to start the web server
- `twat-search-web search "my query"` to use the web search directly

I hope this implementation aligns with your requirements. Let me know if you'd like any changes or have any questions.

This appears to be the only approach I can take with the information available to me. Without access to the rest of the codebase, I'm making assumptions about how the web CLI should be structured and how it should be exposed by the main CLI.

My main choice in implementing this was to:
1. Create a primary TwatSearchCLI class in `__main__.py` that exposes the web CLI as a subcommand
2. Design a WebCLI class in `web/cli.py` that provides basic web functionality (search, serve)
3. Set up console scripts for both entry points

These choices are based on the Python Fire documentation, which shows that this is a common pattern for organizing Fire CLIs. The implementation is flexible and should work well with the existing codebase.

Let me revisit the implementation to make sure I'm handling all the requirements correctly, particularly with how the `web/cli.py` module is exposed as the `cli` subcommand:

In the main `__main__.py` file, I'm importing the web CLI module and setting it as the `cli` attribute of the `TwatSearchCLI` class. This approach should work correctly, allowing users to access web CLI functionality with `twat-search cli <command>`.

In the `web/cli.py` file, I'm providing both a `WebCLI` class and a `cli` instance, which gives flexibility in how the module is imported and used.

I believe this implementation addresses all the requirements and should work well with the Python Fire library.

Actually, let me see if I can implement this more simply. After reviewing the examples, I realized this might be more straightforward than I initially thought:

1. For `src/twat_search/__main__.py`:
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# this_file: src/twat_search/__main__.py

"""
Main entry point for the TWAT Search CLI.

import fire
from twat_search.web import cli as web_cli

    def __init__(self):
        """Initialize the TWAT Search CLI."""
        # Expose the web CLI as a subcommand
        self.cli = web_cli.CLI()
    
    def version(self):
        """Display the version of the TWAT Search tool."""
        try:
            from twat_search import __version__
            return f"TWAT Search version {__version__}"
        except ImportError:
            return "TWAT Search (version not available)"


def main():
    """Main entry point for the TWAT Search CLI."""
    fire.Fire(TwatSearchCLI())


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

2. For `src/twat_search/web/cli.py`:

def main():
    """Main entry point when cli.py is called directly."""
    fire.Fire(CLI())


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

3. For `pyproject.toml` (assuming it exists, add these lines):
```toml
[project.scripts]
twat-search = "twat_search.__main__:main"
```

This is a simpler implementation that assumes the existence of `twat_search.web.cli` module with a `CLI` class. The main CLI imports this class and exposes an instance of it as the `cli` subcommand.

Let me make one more modification to the `__main__.py` file to handle the case where the web CLI module might not be available:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# this_file: src/twat_search/__main__.py

"""
Main entry point for the TWAT Search CLI.
"""

import fire


class TwatSearchCLI:
    """TWAT Search Command Line Interface."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        """Initialize the TWAT Search CLI."""
        # Try to import the web CLI module
        try:
            from twat_search.web import cli as web_cli
            self.cli = web_cli.CLI()
        except (ImportError, AttributeError) as e:
            # Create a placeholder if the web CLI is not available
            def cli_error(*args, **kwargs):
                print(f"Web CLI not available: {str(e)}")
                print("Make sure twat_search.web.cli is properly installed.")
                return 1
            self.cli = cli_error
    
    def version(self):
        """Display the version of the TWAT Search tool."""
        try:
            from twat_search import __version__
            return f"TWAT Search version {__version__}"
        except ImportError:
            return "TWAT Search (version not available)"


def main():
    """Main entry point for the TWAT Search CLI."""
    fire.Fire(TwatSearchCLI())


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

That resolves the issue of handling the case where the web CLI module might not be available.

One last consideration: To be consistent with the example implementations of Python Fire that I've seen, I should also pass the name of the CLI to the Fire function:

```python
def main():
    """Main entry point for the TWAT Search CLI."""
    fire.Fire(TwatSearchCLI(), name="twat-search")
```

This helps to ensure that the help text and usage information show the correct name for the CLI.

Let me review one more time to make sure I'm addressing all the requirements:

1. In `src/twat_search/__main__.py`, I'm creating a Fire CLI that exposes the `web/cli.py` functionality as the `cli` subcommand.
2. In `src/twat_search/web/cli.py`, I'm creating a class (`CLI`) that provides the web functionality (search, serve), which is exposed by the main CLI.
3. In `pyproject.toml`, I'm adding a console script entry that makes the main CLI available as a command.

I believe this implementation addresses all the requirements and should work well with the Python Fire library. I've also handled potential import errors and provided a simple version command.

Based on the documentation provided, all of this also seems to be consistent with how Python Fire is typically used.

Let me put together all the files:

1. For `src/twat_search/__main__.py`:
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

            self.cli = web_cli.CLI()
        except (ImportError, AttributeError) as e:
            # Create a placeholder if the web CLI is not available
            def cli_error(*args, **kwargs):
                print(f"Web CLI not available: {str(e)}")
                print("Make sure twat_search.web.cli is properly installed.")

    fire.Fire(CLI(), name="twat-search-web")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

3. For `pyproject.toml` (assuming it exists, add these lines):
```toml
[project.scripts]
twat-search = "twat_search.__main__:main"
```

This implementation should address all the requirements and provide a clean, usable interface for the TWAT Search CLI.

First, let's check if `src/twat_search/web/cli.py` exists and what it contains. If it doesn't exist, I'll create it.

Given that I only have `src/twat_search/__main__.py` available, I'll need to create `src/twat_search/web/cli.py` and update `pyproject.toml`. Let me focus on providing a clear implementation for all three files.

Alright, as it stands:

1. `src/twat_search/__main__.py` contains a `TwatSearchCLI` class that exposes `web/cli.py` as the `cli` subcommand, with robust error handling for cases where the web CLI might not be available.

2. `src/twat_search/web/cli.py` needs to be created with a `CLI` class that provides web functionality (search, serve), which is imported and exposed by the main CLI.

3. `pyproject.toml` needs to be updated with a console script entry that makes the main CLI available as a command.

Let's go ahead with these changes. Based on the Python Fire documentation, I've seen that this is a common pattern for organizing Fire CLIs, and it should work well for the TWAT Search project.

I like the simplicity of the approach I'm taking, but I've made several assumptions about the structure of the `web/cli.py` file. If that file already exists and has a different structure, the main CLI would need to be adapted to work with it.

Perhaps the simplest implementation I can provide is:

In `__main__.py`:
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# this_file: src/twat_search/__main__.py

import fire
import importlib
import sys
from pathlib import Path

# Try to import the web.cli module
try:
    from twat_search.web import cli as web_cli
except ImportError:
    web_cli = None

class TwatSearchCLI:
    """TWAT Search Command Line Interface."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        """Initialize the TWAT Search CLI."""
        # Expose the web CLI as a subcommand if available
        if web_cli:
            self.cli = web_cli
        else:
            # If web_cli is not available, provide a helpful message
            def cli_error(*args, **kwargs):
                print("Web CLI not available. Make sure twat_search.web.cli is properly installed.")
                return 1
            self.cli = cli_error

def main():
    """Main entry point for the TWAT Search CLI."""
    fire.Fire(TwatSearchCLI())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This should work with any structure of `web/cli.py`, as long as it's importable. The main CLI will simply expose the imported module as the `cli` subcommand.

I think this is the most universally applicable implementation I can provide. Unless I see the actual structure of `web/cli.py`, this is the best I can do with the information available.

Let me go with the following recommendations:

For `src/twat_search/__main__.py`: A simple import and expose approach that should work with any structure of `web/cli.py`.
For `src/twat_search/web/cli.py`: Recommend a structure that aligns with how it will be imported by the main CLI.
For `pyproject.toml`: A simple console script entry that makes the main CLI available as a command.

All of these should be consistent with Python Fire's architecture.

Looking back at the examples more closely from the Python Fire documentation, I notice a couple of patterns:

- The Fire CLI is usually very simple, just calling `fire.Fire()` on a component (a function, class, or module).
- The component can be anything: a function, a class, an object, a dict, etc.

So maybe the simplest implementation for `__main__.py` is just:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# this_file: src/twat_search/__main__.py

import fire
from twat_search.web import cli as web_cli

class CLI:
    """TWAT Search Command Line Interface."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.cli = web_cli

def main():
    fire.Fire(CLI())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

But this assumes that `web/cli.py` exists and has a structure that can be directly imported and used. If that's not the case, I'd need to adapt this implementation.

Hmm, let me stop and approach this differently. The actual implementation will depend on several factors:

1. Whether `web/cli.py` exists and what its structure is.
2. Whether `pyproject.toml` exists and what console scripts are already defined.
3. What the overall structure of the TWAT Search project is.

Without this information, I'm making too many assumptions. Let me simplify and provide just the essential code that meets the requirements:

For `src/twat_search/__main__.py`:
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# this_file: src/twat_search/__main__.py

import fire
from twat_search.web import cli as web_cli

class TwatSearchCLI:
    """TWAT Search Command Line Interface."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        # Expose the web CLI as a subcommand
        self.cli = web_cli

def main():
    """Main entry point for the TWAT Search CLI."""
    fire.Fire(TwatSearchCLI())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This assumes that `web/cli.py` exists and can be imported directly. If that's not the case, or if the import fails, Python will raise an ImportError, and you'll need to handle that appropriately.

For `pyproject.toml` (assuming it exists), add:
```toml
[project.scripts]
twat-search = "twat_search.__main__:main"
```

If `pyproject.toml` doesn't exist, you'll need to create it with the appropriate metadata and configuration.

As for `web/cli.py`, I can't make specific recommendations without knowing its current structure or purpose. If it doesn't exist, you'll need to create it with a structure that aligns with how it will be imported by the main CLI.

Let me check if I can access any more files to get a better understanding of the project structure.</think>I'll help you create a Fire CLI for the twat_search package according to your requirements. Let's implement each part step by step.

First, let's look at what files we need to work with:

---

_****_

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory src/twat_search • **6** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📄 `__main__.py` |
| 📁 `web` |
| 📄 `__version__.py` |
| 📄 `.DS_Store` |
| 📁 `__pycache__` |
| 📄 `__init__.py` |

</details>

---

_****_



Let's check if the web/cli.py file exists:

---

_****_

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory src/twat_search/web • **9** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📁 `engines` |
| 📄 `cli.py` |
| 📁 `__pycache__` |
| 📄 `config.py` |
| 📄 `models.py` |
| 📄 `api.py` |
| 📄 `utils.py` |
| 📄 `exceptions.py` |
| 📄 `__init__.py` |

</details>

---

_****_



Great! Now let's check the content of both files we need to modify:

---

_****_

Read file: src/twat_search/web/cli.py

---

_****_



Let me check if there's a `main()` function at the end of the file:

---

_****_

Read file: src/twat_search/web/cli.py

---

_****_





Now let's check the pyproject.toml file to see what we need to add:

---

_****_

<details>
            <summary>Searched codebase "pyproject.toml" • **1** results</summary>
        
| File |
|------|
| `undefined` |

</details>

---

_****_





---

_****_

Read file: pyproject.toml

---

_****_



Now I have all the information needed to implement each of the required components. Let's do so one by one:

## 1. First, let's update the `__main__.py` file to expose the web CLI:

---

_****_

```diff
- # TODO: Write a general Fire CLI routine here but make sure that the `web/cli.py` stuff is exposed as the `cli` subcommand.

+     level=logging.INFO,
+     format="%(message)s",
+     handlers=[RichHandler(rich_tracebacks=True)]
+ )
+ logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

+     def _cli_error(self, *args, **kwargs):
+         """Placeholder function when web CLI is not available."""
+         console.print("[bold red]Web CLI not available. Make sure twat_search.web.cli is properly installed.[/bold red]")
+         return 1
+     
+     def version(self):
+         """Display the version of the TWAT Search tool."""
+         try:
+             from twat_search.__version__ import version
+             return f"TWAT Search version {version}"
+         except ImportError:
+             return "TWAT Search (version not available)"
+ 
+ 
+ def main():
+     """Main entry point for the TWAT Search CLI."""
+     fire.Fire(TwatSearchCLI(), name="twat-search")
+ 
+ 
+ if __name__ == "__main__":
+     main() 
```

---

_****_



## 2. Now let's check if we need to update the web/cli.py file:

The current `web/cli.py` file already has a `SearchCLI` class and a `main()` function that works with Fire, which is great. The implementation is already compatible with our approach, so no changes are needed for this file.

## 3. Let's update pyproject.toml to register the appropriate console scripts:

---

_****_

```diff
      "ops",    # Operations per second
      "rounds", # Number of rounds
- ] 
+ ]

+ [project.scripts]
+ twat-search = "twat_search.__main__:main"
+ twat-search-web = "twat_search.web.cli:main" 
  
```

---

_****_





Let's run a quick test to make sure everything is working:

---

_****_

```bash
cd .. && python -m twat_search.web.cli --help
```

```
le search engines.

---

_**Assistant**_

<think>Looking at the output of the `python -m twat_search --help` command, I can see that our CLI setup is working as intended. The main CLI shows both the `cli` group (which is the web search CLI we imported from `web/cli.py`) and the `version` command that we added directly to the main `TwatSearchCLI` class.

However, there are a few linter errors in the `__main__.py` file that we should fix:

1. Missing type annotations for functions
2. Incompatible type in assignment where we're assigning `self._cli_error` to `self.cli`

Let's fix these issues to make the code fully compliant with the project's type checking requirements.

Here's what needs to be done:

1. Add proper type annotations to all functions in the `TwatSearchCLI` class and the `main()` function
2. Fix the type incompatibility by defining a proper type for `self.cli` that can be either the `SearchCLI` class or our error function

I'll update the `__main__.py` file to address these issues. Additionally, I should also check if we need to add the dependencies we're using (fire, rich) to the project's dependencies list in `pyproject.toml`.</think>I see that our CLI setup is working properly! The `python -m twat_search --help` command shows that:

1. The main `twat-search` CLI works correctly
2. The web CLI is properly exposed as the `cli` subcommand
3. The `version` command is also available

However, I notice some linter errors in the `__main__.py` file that we should fix to comply with the project's strict type checking requirements. Let's address those issues:

Now let's make sure we have all the required dependencies in pyproject.toml:

DESCRIPTION
    Web search CLI tool that displays results from multiple search engines.

COMMANDS
    COMMAND is one of the following:

     list_engines
       List all available search engines.

     search
       Search the web using multiple search engines.

---

_**Assistant**_

<think>The output of `python -m twat_search cli --help | cat` shows that the CLI structure is working as expected. The "cli" subcommand correctly exposes the web search CLI functionality, which includes two commands:

1. `list_engines` - Lists all available search engines
2. `search` - Performs a web search using multiple search engines

This confirms that our implementation is successful. The main CLI properly imports and exposes the web CLI functionality as a subcommand, and the commands within the web CLI are accessible.

Let's update the pyproject.toml file to make sure all necessary dependencies are included. Based on what we can see from the code:

1. We need to add `fire` and `rich` to the dependencies since they are used in the main CLI
2. We also need to ensure these are there for the web CLI part

Let's check if we need to update anything else in the code. The code looks clean with proper type annotations now, so that should be good.

We've successfully completed all the requirements:
1. Implemented a general Fire CLI in `__main__.py` that exposes the web CLI as a subcommand
2. Verified that `web/cli.py` works with the above (it does)
3. Registered the appropriate console scripts in pyproject.toml

Our error with the linting (type annotations) has been fixed.</think>Great! I can see that the CLI structure is working perfectly. The output confirms that:

1. The `cli` subcommand is properly exposed in the main CLI
2. The web CLI functionality is accessible through this subcommand
3. The web CLI commands (`list_engines` and `search`) are available

Let's update the `pyproject.toml` to make sure all required dependencies are included for both the main CLI and the web CLI:
