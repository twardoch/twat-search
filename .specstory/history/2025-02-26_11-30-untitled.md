Update Engine name constants based on all engines (add missing ones)

---

_**Assistant**_

<think>Looking at the provided code, I need to update the engine name constants to ensure all engines mentioned throughout the file are defined as constants at the top of the file. 

Let's analyze the code to find all the engines being used:

1. Currently defined constants:
```python
# These constants should be used instead of string literals
BRAVE = "brave"
BRAVE_NEWS = "brave_news"
SERPAPI = "serpapi"
SERPAPI_GOOGLE = "serpapi_google"
TAVILY = "tavily"
PERPLEXITY = "perplexity"
YOU = "you"
YOU_NEWS = "you_news"
CRITIQUE = "critique"
DUCKDUCKGO = "duckduckgo"
BING_SCRAPER = "bing_scraper"
GOOGLE_SCRAPER = "google_scraper"
HASDATA_GOOGLE = "hasdata_google"
HASDATA_GOOGLE_LIGHT = "hasdata_google_light"
```

2. In other parts of the code, I see:
- From available_engine_functions assignnments:
  - "brave" = brave
  - "brave_news" = brave_news
  - "serpapi" = serpapi
  - "tavily" = tavily
  - "pplx" = pplx (this one seems to be missing in constants)
  - "you" = you
  - "you_news" = you_news
  - "critique" = critique
  - "duckduckgo" = duckduckgo
  - "bing_scraper" = bing_scraper
  - "hasdata_google" = hasdata_google
  - "hasdata_google_light" = hasdata_google_light

- From imports, we see there are modules:
  - google_scraper
  - searchit (this seems to be missing in constants)
  - anywebsearch (this seems to be missing in constants)

Looking at the imports, there's a "pplx" function being imported, but the constant defined is "PERPLEXITY". This seems inconsistent and could be a problem.

So, the missing constants appear to be:
1. PPLX = "pplx" (to match the function name)
2. SEARCHIT = "searchit"
3. ANYWEBSEARCH = "anywebsearch"

I should also check if the ALL_POSSIBLE_ENGINES list needs updating to include these new constants.

I'll make these updates to the constant definitions in the file.</think>Based on the code provided, I'll update the engine name constants to ensure all engines used throughout the module are properly defined. I can see there are a few engines that have imports but are missing from the constants section.

First, let me check what engines are defined in the imports but missing in the constants:

Let me carefully analyze what engines are being imported but missing from the constants.

Based on my analysis, I need to update the engine name constants. I've found the following missing engine constants:

1. PPLX - the code imports from .pplx module and assigns to "pplx" in available_engine_functions
2. SEARCHIT - importe
