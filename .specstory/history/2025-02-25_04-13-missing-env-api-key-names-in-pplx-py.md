## Missing env_api_key_names in pplx.py (25/02/2025, 04:13:38)

_**User**_

@pplx.py does nto have the equivalent of

name = "you"
env_api_key_names: ClassVar[list[str]] = [
    "YOUCOM_API_KEY",
    "YOUCOM_SEARCH_API_KEY",
    "YOU_API_KEY",
]

but should

<think>Let me analyze the issue. The user is pointing out that the `pplx.py` file (for the Perplexity AI search engine) is missing something that the `you.py` file (for the You.com search engine) has, specifically:

```python
name = "you"
env_api_key_names: ClassVar[list[str]] = [
    "YOUCOM_API_KEY",
    "YOUCOM_SEARCH_API_KEY",
    "YOU_API_KEY",
]
```

Looking at both files:

1. **you.py**:
   - Has a `name` class variable: `name = "you"`
   - Has an `env_api_key_names` class variable listing possible environment variable names for API keys

2. **pplx.py**: 
   - Has a `name` class variable: `name = "perplexity"`
   - Does NOT have an `env_api_key_names` class variable

The `env_api_key_names` variable in the `you.py` file is defined as a class variable with type annotation `ClassVar[list[str]]`. It seems to list environment variable names that can be used to provide the API key for the You.com search engine.

In `pplx.py`, there's a reference to an environment variable in the error message when the API key is missing: "Set it in config or the PERPLEXITYAI_API_KEY env var". This suggests that the Perplexity search engine should also check for this environment variable name, along with possible alternatives.

To fix this issue, I need to add the `env_api_key_names` class variable to the `PerplexitySearchEngine` class in `pplx.py`, including potential environment variable names for the Perplexity API key.

The fix would involve:
1. Adding the import for `ClassVar` from `typing` if it's not already there
2. Adding the `env_api_key_names` class variable listing potential environment variable names for the Perplexity API key

This needs to be added to the `PerplexitySearchEngine` class in `pplx.py`, similar to how it's defined in the `YouSearchEngine` class in `you.py`.</think>Looking at the code, I can see that `pplx.py` is missing the `env_api_key_names` class variable that's present in `you.py`. This class variable defines the environment variable names that can contain the API key for the search engine.

I'll add this to the `PerplexitySearchEngine` class in `pplx.py`:

```diff
  
  import httpx
+ from typing import ClassVar
  from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, ValidationError
  
  
      name = "perplexity"
+     env_api_key_names: ClassVar[list[str]] = [
+         "PERPLEXITYAI_API_KEY",
+         "PERPLEXITY_API_KEY",
+         "PPLX_API_KEY",
+     ]
  
      def __init__(self, config: EngineConfig, model: str | None = None) -> None:
```

Now the `PerplexitySearchEngine` class has an `env_api_key_names` class variable that lists the possible environment variable names for the Perplexity API key, similar to what the `YouSearchEngine` class has in `you.py`.

The added environment variable names are:
- `PERPLEXITYAI_API_KEY` (matching the error message)
- `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` (common alternative)
- `PPLX_API_KEY` (short form)

This allows the search engine to look for the API key in multiple environment variables, providing more flexibility to the user when configuring the application.

Wait, but I should also check if the `base.py` file is properly implementing the logic to use these environment variable names. Since I don't have access to that file, I'm making an assumption that the `SearchEngine` base class correctly uses the `env_api_key_names` class variable to look for API keys in the environment.

<think>I've successfully added the `env_api_key_names` class variable to the `PerplexitySearchEngine` class, but I notice in the error message that appears after the cursor position, there's a hardcoded mention of "PERPLEXITYAI_API_KEY" in the error message. Now I should update this error message to reference the environment variables listed in the `env_api_key_names` class variable for consistency.

The current error message is:
```python
raise EngineError(
    self.name,
    "Perplexity API key is required. Set it in config or the PERPLEXITYAI_API_KEY env var.",
)
```

I should update it to reference all the environment variables in the `env_api_key_names` list, similar to how it might be done in the `you.py` file. I'll need to edit this part of the code.</think>I see that the error message in the `PerplexitySearchEngine` class only mentions one of the potential environment variables (`PERPLEXITYAI_API_KEY`), but it should reference all the options we've defined in the `env_api_key_names` class variable. Let's update that error message to be consistent with our added environment variables:

---

```diff
              raise EngineError(
                  self.name,
-                 "Perplexity API key is required. Set it in config or the PERPLEXITYAI_API_KEY env var.",
+                 f"Perplexity API key is required. Set it in config or via one of these env vars: {', '.join(self.env_api_key_names)}.",
              )
  
```

---

Now the error message will dynamically list all the environment variables that can be used to set the Perplexity API key, making it more helpful for users. The message will display:

"Perplexity API key is required. Set it in config or via one of these env vars: PERPLEXITYAI_API_KEY, PERPLEXITY_API_KEY, PPLX_API_KEY."

This follows the same pattern as the `YouSearchEngine` class and makes the implementation more consistent. If any environment variable names are added or changed in the future, the error message will automatically reflect those changes.

I also notice there are linter errors related to type issues later in the file (with HTTP URLs and the Perplexity response parsing), but those appear to be separate from the current task of adding the environment variable names.

Wait, but I should also check if there are any other places in the code that might need updating to match this change, though this looks like the most important one.
