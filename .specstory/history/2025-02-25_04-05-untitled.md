We now have you.py and youcom.py — we should only have you.py

_**Assistant**_

<think>The user's query indicates that there are two files, `you.py` and `youcom.py`, and they want to consolidate them into just `you.py`. I'm currently looking at `youcom.py`, and I need to understand what's in `you.py` so I can appropriately merge them.

First, let me search for the `you.py` file in the codebase to understand its content. Then I'll figure out how to merge these files.

Let's first check if there's a file called `you.py` in the same directory:</think>I'll help you consolidate these files. Let's first find the `you.py` file to see what's in it, so we can properly merge the content.

Great! I've found both files. Let's examine the content of `you.py` to see what we need to consolidate:

Read file: src/twat_search/web/engines/you.py

Now I understand the situation. Let me compare the two files:

1. `you.py` has:
   - A simpler implementation focused on general search
   - Uses class name `YoucomSearchEngine` with name="youcom"
   - Uses a different API endpoint (api.ydc-index.io/search)
   - Has simpler models with basic validation

2. `youcom.py` has:
   - More advanced implementation with additional search features
   - Two search engines: `YouSearchEngine` and `YouNewsSearchEngine`
   - Uses newer API endpoints (api.you.com/api/search and api.you.com/api/news)
   - Has more detailed models with stricter validation

I'll consolidate these into a single `you.py` file, keeping the newer implementation from `youcom.py` but preserving any unique functionality from `you.py` if needed.

Let's first create the consolidated file:
