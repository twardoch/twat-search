- [ ] See [TODO.md](TODO.md) for the list of upcoming features planned for future development.
- [x] Test planning completed (see detailed plan in [TODO.md](TODO.md))
- [ ] Tests implementation
- [ ] CLI tool for terminal-based searching

## Unified Parameter Implementation

### Completed:
- [x] Defined common parameters in base `SearchEngine` class:
  - `num_results`: Number of results to return
  - `country`: Country code for results
  - `language`: Language code for results
  - `safe_search`: Boolean flag for safe search
  - `time_frame`: Time frame for filtering results
- [x] Updated search engines to use unified parameters:
  - [x] BraveSearchEngine and BraveNewsSearchEngine
  - [x] YouSearchEngine and YouNewsSearchEngine
  - [x] SerpApiSearchEngine
  - [x] TavilySearchEngine
  - [x] PerplexitySearchEngine
  - [x] CritiqueSearchEngine (new implementation)
- [x] Updated convenience functions for all engines to expose unified parameters
- [x] Fixed type conversion issues with URL handling
- [x] Ensured proper validation and error handling for parameters
- [x] Added CLI support for all engines including the new Critique engine

### Next steps:
- [ ] Write unit tests to verify unified parameter handling works correctly
- [ ] Update documentation to reflect the unified parameters
- [ ] Add docstrings explaining the mapping between unified parameters and engine-specific ones
