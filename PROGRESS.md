## Completed
- [x] Defined common parameters in base `SearchEngine` class
- [x] Updated search engines to use unified parameters
- [x] Added support for multiple search engines (Brave, Tavily, Perplexity, You.com, SerpAPI, Critique, DuckDuckGo)
- [x] Implemented initial version of Bing Scraper engine
- [x] Created basic testing infrastructure

## In Progress
- [ ] Fixing type checking and linting issues identified in cleanup report
- [ ] Completing Bing Scraper implementation and tests
- [ ] Addressing failing test in config environment variable loading

## Upcoming
- [ ] Enhancing test framework with mocks and fixtures
- [ ] Standardizing error handling across all engines
- [ ] Improving documentation and adding comprehensive examples
- [ ] Implementing performance optimizations
- [ ] Adding advanced features (caching, rate limiting, result normalization)

## Known Issues
- Environment variable loading not working correctly in tests
- Missing type annotations in several modules
- Excessive parameter counts in engine initialization methods
- Skipped tests for asynchronous components

See [TODO.md](TODO.md) for the detailed task breakdown and implementation plans.
